# Documenting API Endpoint Deprecation: the Art of Announcing Changes

As a freelance software technical writer, I usually spend between half and a third of my time to care for API documentation, depending on the project and the company I am working for.&#x20;

This can go from testing endpoints one by one to adjusting the endpoint classification in the documentation, enriching endpoint descriptions, renaming the endpoints to be understood by human beings, enriching parameter's descriptions, writing changelog posts, writing error messages, anticipating changes coming in the next version of the API, writing API guides, etc.

APIs are so critical to business growth those days, they usually evolve fast, which implies a constant stream of new endpoints to document as well as ancient endpoints being deprecated. Deprecating an endpoint means it will stop working in a close future, so the users need to be redirected to another way to perform the same task.&#x20;

There are several reasons for deprecating endpoints, which include but are not limited to:

* [ ] Technical debt
* [ ] Decrease in usage
* [ ] Security issues
* [ ] Performance reasons
* [ ] Improving the user experience
