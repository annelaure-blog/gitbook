# "Readme Refactored": New Features for Documenting APIs are Coming in 2025

Readme.com is one of the most popular CMS out there to build developer portals that feature interactive API references, guides, recipes, changelogs and more. It is very easy to use for non-technical people (everything can be set up and edited from a quite straightforward back-office space), and provides a few interesting features such as a built-in glossary, search, "suggest edit", and a solid versioning tool.

I have used Readme for about half of the projects I have worked on as a freelance technical writer, and for most companies I find it to be a very good fit to manage large groups of users, multiple projects, as well as massive amounts of pages and big API specs (that is on the Entreprise - most expensive plan).

Yet Readme was not - so far - made for docs-as-code processes as it did not allow synchronizing with GitHub, so all edits had to be made through the back-office (where sometimes people struggle to log into if there are many people contributing), and there was no option to have a content back-up on GitHub. It was not either a place to easily edit Open API files (even if you can easily add content to each endpoint page generated from the spec), nor very flexible in terms of interactive components within the pages.&#x20;

Good news, Readme.com announced a bunch of new exciting featured to come in 2025, which I look forward to having available for my clients.&#x20;
