# "Readme Refactored": Exciting New Features for Documenting APIs Coming in 2025

## What is Readme.com?

[Readme.com](https://readme.com/) is one of the most popular CMS out there to build developer portals. It features interactive API references, guides, recipes, changelogs and more.&#x20;

It is very easy to use for non-technical people (everything can be set up and edited from a quite straightforward back-office space), and provides a few interesting features such as:

* [x] an interactive API Spec display (where users can perform live tests),
* [x] a built-in glossary,&#x20;
* [x] a search function,&#x20;
* [x] a "suggest edit" feature,
* [x] a solid versioning tool,&#x20;
* [x] a reusable content feature, etc.

I have used Readme for about half of the projects I have worked on as a freelance technical writer, and for most companies I find it to be a very good fit to manage large groups of users, multiple projects, as well as massive amounts of pages and big API specs in one back-office.

Yet, Readme was not - so far - made for docs-as-code processes. It did not allow synchronizing with GitHub, so all edits had to be made through the back-office itself (where sometimes people struggle to log into), and there was no simple option to have a back-up on GitHub or to download the documentation's content all at once.&#x20;

Good news, Readme.com announced a bunch of new exciting featured to come in 2025, which I look forward to having available for my clients, and for me in my daily tasks.&#x20;

It is called "Readme Refactored", and below is a breakdown of the most exciting changes to come.

While not thrilled by the use of a live animal to perform this awkward announcement ceremony, I was by the following features:
