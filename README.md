# Anne-Laure Fr√©ant

Professional with 15 years of experience in the tech sector as a **technical content specialist**, first in Canada for the travel startup [Hopper](http://hopper.com) and then in France for various public institutions (French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Services [Etalab](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/)).

I evolved from editorial project management and UX writing towards **full-time technical writing** **in 2020**, working as a **freelance technical writer** while taking courses to enrich my skills.&#x20;

I gained lots of experience joining the [ContentSquare](https://contentsquare.com/) Knowledge Management Team in 2022 for a 6-month full-time contract as a technical writer.&#x20;

Since then, I work on mid-term to long-term contracts for SaaS companies and startups on creating user guides ([Quantic Factory,](https://www.quanticfy.io/) [Djust](https://fr.djust.io/), [Hyperline](projects/hyperline-user-documentation.md)), developers portals ([Quable](projects/quable-developer-portal.md), Akeneo), or both ([Rumo](projects/rumo-dashboard-and-api.md)) to adjust wording and UX writing in the product.&#x20;

I have been working as a full-time contractor on [Criteo's developer portal ](https://developers.criteo.com/)since July 2024.\
