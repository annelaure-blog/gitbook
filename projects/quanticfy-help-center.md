# ðŸ“Š Quanticfy Help Center

Working closely with Quanticfy's CEO and CTO, I am writing the complete user guide documentation (around 60 articles) from scratch. This project involves a lot of pedagogical content that makes data science notions and computation methods accessible to a non-tech audience.

Quanticfy is a data analytics solution for Shopify owners. It is customer and UTM-centric (tracks every online ads URLs) and provides e-shop owners with precise attribution data.

For this project, we are working with the Intercom CMS and AI-powered Chatbot.\
The Help Center is accessible here: [https://intercom-help.eu/the-quantic-factory/en/](https://intercom-help.eu/the-quantic-factory/en/)
