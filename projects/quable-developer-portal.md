# üë©‚Äçüíª Quable Developer Portal

[Quable](https://www.quable.com/) is the PIM (Product Information Management) & DAM (Digital Asset Management) solution for brands and manufacturers seeking growth. Over 250 major brands in 85 countries have chosen Quable PIM to help their omnichannel business take off.

Along with the Support Team lead and co-founder of Quable, we are building a brand new updated and enriched developer portal and API documentation (including Postman collections and cookbooks) on Retype.

The portal is published here (since october 2023): [https://developers.quable.com/](https://developers.quable.com/)

_**Tools: Retype, Visual Studio Code (markdown, yml), Postman for collections and API reference**_
