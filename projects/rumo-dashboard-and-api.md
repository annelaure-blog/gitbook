# ðŸ“º Rumo Dashboard & API

[Rumo](https://www.rumo.co/) is a SaaS recommendation system engine for entertainment content platforms. It helps deliver personalized recommendations to improve user acquisition, retention and boost the discoverability of content.

I conducted a short-term mission for Rumo's product team to have a general look at the dashboard UX writing, naming conventions and to clarify and uniformize the content of the API reference documentation (mainly for endpoints descriptions and summaries). \
\
Rumo's API documentation is available here: [https://apidoc.rumo.co/#post-/content](https://apidoc.rumo.co/#post-/content)

The dashboard is only visible to customers with an account.

_**Tools:** Rapidoc, Visual Studio Code (for the yml file), Google Spreadsheet_
