description: 6 month full-time contract (Feb - July 2020)

# ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Data.gouv.fr

Data.gouv.fr is the french official open data platform. It is managed by the Etalab Service, within the Prime Minister Services. I joined the data.gouv.fr team for a 6 month full-time contract as a "Data Editor" in 2020, right at the beginning of the pandemic when health data became critical in a few weeks.

As categories are not an available feature of CKAN (the open source tool used to build the platform), I suggested [we build thematic dataset collections pages](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/thematiques-a-la-une/), and created the first one related to COVID-19 data. There are now many thematic dataset pages on the platform.\
\
I also wrote dataset descriptions, metadata schemes, the first newsletter of the platform and contributed to the Etalab blog. I handled the Twitter account to post about new datasets and open data news. I contributed to a few sections of the [data.gouv.fr documentation](https://doc.data.gouv.fr/) as well (using Github & Jekyll).\

All content was written in Markdown.
