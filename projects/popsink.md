# 🔌 Popsink

I migrated the entire existing Popsink documentation from MKDocs to Mintlify, using scripts to "translate" the content from Markdown to the MDX format. I also rearranged the content to improve findability and general navigation, and adapted the Swagger organization to display properly by categories of endpoints.
