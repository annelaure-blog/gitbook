# üè™ Djust Help Center

I am working with the executives at[ Djust ](https://www.djust.io/)to build new, harmonized, and exhaustive functional documentation for the e-commerce SAAS platform.

Starting all over from the User Journey, we redefined a documentation structure with a dozen sections that explain in detail how to proceed from the moment Djust's customers get their access to the app to the moment they launch their e-commerce website or marketplace.\
\
We worked from the user's point of view to ensure the content is clear, and easy to read, with the relevant steps. From suppliers to customer accounts management to data model configuration and product creation, the documentation covers all major aspects of creating an e-commerce/marketplace website with Djust's solution.

The content I wrote (around 100 pages) will be injected in a website generator, and will be handled from there by the new in-house technical writing team starting in October 2023.

The documentation is accessible to customers and partners only.&#x20;
