# ðŸŸ  Criteo Developer Portal

I have started a full-time contract for the Ad Tech company Criteo in July 2024. \
\
Since then, within the Integration Enablement & Addressability team, I am working on revamping the Developer Portal on all the three projects it contains: the Retailer Integration documentation, the Retail Media API one as well as the Commerce Marketing Solution API documentation.

I have worked on defining a technical writing framework, a style guide and processes to help bring the documentation to a higher standard of clarity, searchability and exhaustiveness. We are also working on enhancing the API interactivity within Readme, as well as improving the update flow internally.

My role involves to collaborate within my team and with several product teams (Commerce Video, Retail Media API, Delivery API) and also local Ops teams and R\&D, to add new content, update and improve existing one. I also contributed to the reflection about crafting a new homepage, and general user flow between Criteo resources and the Developer Portal.

Testing and documenting the new Readme features planned for 2025 is also part of my role to see how Criteo's documentation can benefit from them the most in the future. This includes looking at the new editor, MDX availability as well as API interactivity features and Github sync, etc.
