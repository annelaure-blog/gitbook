# üêá Hopper Research Blog

My first job out of college was to be a part-time data entry employee for the early-stages travel startup Hopper. I started by doing data entry, then I was offered to become the data entry team-lead. I was in charge of monitoring the content team's productivity, conducting recruiting tests, training new employees, reporting directly to CEO Frederic Lalonde.&#x20;

Immersed in a highly innovative, fast-pace environment, I learned all about big data, elastic search, the daily life of developers, and how to turn a travel database technology into a successful product. Hopper since became one of the most popular travel app in the world with more than 30 million users. [It has been valued $5B](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/03/hopper/?guccounter=1\&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8\&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMWLSCeb3t_eBysBVWgi_FMNSltRtKYjPfKczu5lT5FrarjYted9WFt8AmRqQuAzTaLl9EhFZuKiVml19_rqIwFD8ZKdWu8hwfsYz0pIgsvTH7Qbcu2RX0qdKOk0wc-MlTBbhV9vLz2Z-6rYwfYHU0RAosIumJ-YbcSkG5TELa4j).

I was offered a full-time position a few months later. I then worked on defining the editorial line for [Hopper Research Blog](https://media.hopper.com/research), along with data scientist Patrick Surry and now Hopper's Director, Dakota Smith, to showcase Hopper's expertise regarding the travel market.
