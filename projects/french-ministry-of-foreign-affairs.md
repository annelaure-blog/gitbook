# ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French Ministry of Foreign Affairs

In 2014, I came back to France after 5 years spent in Canada and one year spent in New-Zealand. As I struggled to find information about how to reintegrate, I founded a digital portal to help people looking for information on administrative, professional and psychological aspects of reentry. I also wrote a 100-page e-book that I update every year ever since with all the essential information to reentry.

This project got the attention of the DINUM (the national French administration for digital innovation) and I became a consultant for them to build an online public service to help people preparing their reentry to France. I contributed both to the UX writing and algorithm construction of the tool.

I then did the editorial maintenance of the tool for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 2016 to 2020, when it got transferred to the service managing the official administrative information portal services-publics.fr.

The project was featured in the media (Les Echos, Radio Canada, France Culture, LibÃ©ration, etc.) and also includes a self-help community of 30k members over Facebook.&#x20;
