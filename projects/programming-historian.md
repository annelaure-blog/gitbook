# 👩‍🎓 Programming Historian

The Programming Historian non-profit organization provides free data science tutorials for historians to conduct analysis of all types of data corpus (images, ancient texts, etc.).

I contributed to the english to french translations of [a dozen lessons.](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/)\
The work was done in Markdown.
