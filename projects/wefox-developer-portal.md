# üè° WeFox Developer Portal

[WeFox](https://www.wefox.com/) is an independent insurance platform based in Berlin, Germany, that helps you find the best policies from over 200 providers and curates them for you. It offers to all insurance players the possibility to create and sell insurance products online.

Along with the product team, we are reviewing and enriching the existing developer documentation, writing guidelines for the API documentation publication and maintenance, as well as guides to perform specific procedures requiring a more complex set of several API requests. As multiple teams are in charge of sets of endpoints, we are also working on naming consistency and conventions across the whole documentation.\
\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;his project is ongoing, and the portal is not publicly available yet._
