description: Akeneo PIM's developer documentation migration (Jan 2024 ...)
---

# ðŸ’» Akeneo Developer Portal

[Akeneo](https://www.akeneo.com/) is a major PIM SaaS solution. Used by thousands of clients and partners around the world, the Akeneo products allow managing extensive product catalogs, integrating and creating custom apps for ERP, e-commerce, multichannel management and more.\
\
The current documentation was a bit scattered across multiple websites and pages, and had been built over-time by multiple teams, so it lacked a bit of cohesiveness. \
\
Our goal for this project is to curate, reorganize and migrate a clean, up-to-date and properly structured content into a read.me that will become the new Akeneo's developer portal. The project also involves the complete rewriting of the Open API specification (currently Swagger, 2.0) to fit within read.me while maintaining interactivity.\
\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;his project is ongoing_\
\
&#xNAN;_**Tools: read.me, Visual Studio Code, Swagger UI, Postman**_
